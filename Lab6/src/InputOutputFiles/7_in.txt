The pseudocode in these assignments is a simplified subset and mix
of high level programming languages such as C++, Java, and Python.
As the programming languages are very different, it is not possible
for pseudocode completely to resemble any given language. Some
pseudocode features are similar to C++, some to Java, and some to
Python.
